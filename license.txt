This project includes a modified version of the original "Clothoids" library
by Enrico Bertolazzi and Marco Frego, adapted to work with embedded platforms
(e.g., microcontrollers) with reduced dependencies and improved portability.

Modifications include:
- Lightweight refactoring of code for embedded compatibility
- Removal or replacement of non-essential dependencies
- Adaptation of numerical methods to work with limited precision environments
- Improved build system for cross-platform and cross-compilation use

These changes were made with the intent of preserving the mathematical
robustness of the original implementation while enabling its use in 
resource-constrained systems.
